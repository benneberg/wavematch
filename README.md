## Overview

**WaveMatch** is a neo-brutalist audio puzzle game that trains perception in waveform analysis and sound synthesis. Built directly on the Web Audio API without third-party audio libraries, the gam[...]  

WaveMatch combines education, intuition, and arcade-like pressure into a clean, modern audio-visual experience.

---

## Game Objectives

Match your **User Signal** (blue) to the **Target Signal** (red) by adjusting frequency, gain, waveform shape, detuning, and filters.

Players are evaluated across:

1. **Visual Alignment** — Match waveform geometry.
2. **Aural Comparison** — Use “Hold to Compare” to hear differences.
3. **Accuracy Threshold** — Achieve **85%+ match** to clear a level.
4. **Streak Mechanics** — Maintain streaks for exponential score multipliers.

---

## Game Modes

### 1. Campaign Mode

Progress through four difficulty tiers:

* **Tone Deaf** — Sine waves
* **Wanna Be** — Square waves
* **Pro DJ** — Sawtooth waves with detuning
* **Guru** — Triangle wave precision puzzles

### 2. Daily Glitch

A daily, global challenge generated by date-seeded levels. One attempt per day.

### 3. Infinite Surf

Endless arcade survival. Each cleared puzzle adds time to the clock.

### 4. Waves of Nerves

A speedrun mode: time decays rapidly; final score = *Time Remaining × Accuracy*.

### 5. Sampler Clash (Experimental)

Record your voice or upload audio. The engine warps your sample, and you must match it using playback speed and filter controls.

---

## Controls & Mechanics

* **Wave Shape** — Sine, Square, Sawtooth, Triangle
* **Frequency / Playback Speed** — Pitch control; affects waveform width
* **Gain** — Volume; affects waveform height
* **Fine Tune** — Cents-level pitch adjustments
* **Filter Cutoff** — Available in sampler mode
* **“Hold to Compare”** — A/B comparison of target vs. user signal

---

## Technology Stack

WaveMatch uses a fully custom audio engine with no external synthesis frameworks.

* **Framework:** React 19
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (custom neo-brutalist design)
* **Audio:** Native Web Audio API

  * `OscillatorNode` (signal synthesis)
  * `AnalyserNode` (FFT visualization)
  * `BiquadFilterNode` (filtering)
  * `MediaRecorder` (microphone sampling)
* **Other:** Lucide React icons, Vite, modern browser APIs

---

## Mobile Experience

Designed for full usability on touch devices:

* 100dvh layout prevents mobile browser chrome issues
* Enlarged touch areas for sliders
* Floating “Commit” button for thumb-reach ergonomics

---

## Installation & Development

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```
npm run build
```

---

## Current Status (v1.0)

This is the first public release.

### Notes & Limitations

* Best performance in Chrome, Edge, and Safari.
* Microphone access requires HTTPS (iOS especially).
* High scores and progress stored locally on device for this first version.

---

## Roadmap

* Online global leaderboards
* ADSR envelopes, LFOs, and advanced modulation
* Expanded sampler tools and filter options
* PWA installable version
* Potential collaboration with music-tech brands for educational integrations
